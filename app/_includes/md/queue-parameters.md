<!-- shared with plugins that use queues: http-log, datadog, statsd, opentelemetry -->
    - name: name
      type: string
      description: >
          Name of the queue, unique across the workspace.
          If two plugins instances share a queue name, entries will be
          processed together.
    - name: batch_max_size
      type: number
      default: 1
      description: Maximum number of entries to be processed together
          as a batch.
    - name: max_delay
      type: number
      default: 1
      description: >
          Maximum number of (fractional) seconds to elapse
          after the first entry was queued before the queue starts
          processing entries.  This parameter has no effect when
          `batch_max_size` is 1
    - name: capacity
      type: number
      default: 10000
      description: >
          Maximum number of entries that can be waiting on the queue.
          Once this number of requests is reached, the oldest entry is
          deleted from the queue before a new one is added.
    - name: string_capacity
      type: number
      default: nil
      description:
          Maximum number of bytes that can be waiting on a queue. 
          Once this many bytes are present on a queue, old entries
          up to the size of a new entry to be enqueued are deleted
          from the queue.
    - name: max_retry_time
      type: number
      default: 60
      description: >
          Time in seconds before the queue gives up trying to send a
          batch of entries.  Once this time is exceeded for a batch,
          it is deleted from the queue without having been sent.
    - name: max_retry_delay
      type: number
      default: 60
      description: >
          Maximum time in seconds between retries sending a batch of
          entries.  The interval between retries follows an
          exponential back-off algorithm capped at this number of
          seconds.
